    <summary><h3>Is govt going to ban PUBG and Free Fire in Bangladesh?</h3></summary>
    <img src="../assests/pubgbanned.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="200">
    <p>Popular Battle Royale games PUBG and Free Fire may face a ban in Bangladesh in the near future. Citing concerns 
        over its addiction among teenagers and young adults, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Home Affairs 
        is working together to recommend the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission, BTRC to block the two 
        games in the country. Mustafa Jabbar, Minister of Post and Telecommunication, however, says that his ministry has 
        not received any directives regarding the ban. "Neither me nor my ministry, are aware of any such developments. Although 
        we have the tools, we cannot block these sites or games on our own. We need to act on recommendations from other concerned
        government or law enforcement agencies. We did not receive any such recommendations as of yet," said the minister.
